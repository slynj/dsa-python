# ğŸ’¡Â  problem analysis & summary

- For each test case, given a sentence consisting of words, reverse each word in the sentence while maintaining the word order in the sentence.

# ğŸ’¡Â  algorithm structure

- Split the sentence into individual words using theÂ `split()`Â method.
- Reverse each word using string slicingÂ `[::-1]`.
- After reversing each word, join the words back into a sentence usingÂ `' '.join()`Â to maintain the word order.

# ğŸ’¡Â Â code

```python
T = int(input())

for i in range(T):
    sentence = input()
    reversed_sentence = ' '.join([word[::-1] for word in sentence.split()])
    print(reversed_sentence)
```

# ğŸ’¡Â  time complexity

- `O(T * N)`, whereÂ `T`Â is the number of sentences andÂ `N`Â is the average length of each sentence.

# ğŸ’¡Â  cause of failure

- Wasnâ€™t properly understanding the role of join and split

# ğŸ’¡Â  fix & alternative approach

- **Stack for Each Word**:
    - For each word in the sentence, push all characters into a stack.
    - Then, pop characters from the stack to reverse the word.
- **Maintain Word Order**:
    - After reversing each word, maintain the word order by appending each reversed word into a result list.
- **Print the Result**:
    - After processing all the words, join them with spaces and print the final reversed sentence.

```python
T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):
    sentence = input()
    result = []
    
    # Process each word in the sentence
    for word in sentence.split():
        stack = list(word)  # Push all characters of the word onto a stack
        reversed_word = ''
        
        # Pop characters from stack to reverse the word
        while stack:
            reversed_word += stack.pop()
        
        result.append(reversed_word)
    
    # Join the reversed words with spaces and print the result
    print(' '.join(result))
```
