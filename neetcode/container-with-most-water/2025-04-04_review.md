# ðŸ’¡Approach

### edge cases

### brainstorm

- Bruteforce
    - go through all the combinations from the 2 ends and find the max. area saving the max area value.

### plan

- move the pointers from each end to the middle

### time complexity

$O(n)$

- where $n$ is the number of heights

### space complexity

$O(1)$

- no extra space

# ðŸ’¡Â Problem Analysis

### summary

- given a list of heights, return the maximum area that can be made by drawing a rectangle along the bar

### code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(heights) - 1

        max_height = 0

        while l < r:
            area = (r - l) * min(heights[l], heights[r])
            if area > max_height:
                max_height = area

            if heights[l] < heights[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
            
        return max_height
```

### cause of failure

- 

### take aways & key points

- just move the one that has a smaller value because why would we move the one that has more potential to create bigger area

set pointers at each end â†’ calculate area â†’ move the pointer that has a smaller height â†’ find max
