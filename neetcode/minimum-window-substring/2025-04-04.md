# 💡Approach

### edge cases

- exactly the substring (xyz, xyz)
- having duplicates (xyz, xxyz → “”)

### brainstorm

- Bruteforce
    - finding all combinations of the substring to find the one that includes all the characters in the given substring.

### time complexity

$O(n)$

- where $n$ is the number of chars in string 1

### space complexity

$O(m)$

- where $m$ is the number of unique chars in string 1

# 💡 Problem Analysis

### summary

- given a 2 strings, return the minimum length substring of the first string that includes all the chars from the second string.

### code

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if t == "": 
            return ""

        countT, window = {}, {}

        for c in t:
            countT[c] = 1 + countT.get(c, 0)
        
        have, need = 0, len(countT)
        res, resLen = [-1, -1], float("infinity")

        l = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            c = s[r]
            window[c] = 1 + window.get(c, 0)

            if c in countT and window[c] == countT[c]:
                have += 1
            
            while have == need:
                # update result
                if (r - l + 1) < resLen:
                    res = [l, r]
                    resLen = (r - l + 1)

                # pop from the left of window (since the have == need)
                window[s[l]] -= 1

                if s[l] in countT and window[s[l]] < countT[s[l]]:
                    have -=1

                l += 1
            
        l, r = res
        return s[l : r + 1] if resLen != float("infinity") else ""
                

```

### cause of failure

- tried doing it with moving 2 pointers and moving the right ptr back to where left pointer was but this made the time complexity go up → timed out

### take aways & key points

- repeating $O(1)$ operations are good!

# 💡 One Line Summary

<aside>
📌

create 2 hashmaps: window, t (acc string, substring) → init t hasmap with the chars needed and the count → count the number of “completed chars” → this basically counts how many chars met the requirements (if there are 2 As and 4 Bs, the count is 2 : A and B) → move the right pointer to the right until the requirement numbers are EQUAL → iff the number of chars for both window and t are equal update the “have” count → if have count is equal to the need, move the left pointer until its not equal again so we can find new combination → store the index and length, only update if length is the minimum → keep on moving to the right if the have is not equal to the need
