# ðŸ’¡Approach

### edge cases

- empty list

### brainstorm

- Bruteforce
    - select each element and try to create a consecutive sequence
    - store the length of the sequence if it was able to
    - does not meet the TC requirement
- Sorting
    - sort the list then go through each element to keep the track of the maximum consecutive nums
    - does not meet the TC requirement
- Hashmap
    - find the minimum and maximum, create a hashmap of that length
    - reset the counter everytime you see an empty value

### plan

- find min max, create the hash map of that length
- store the consecutive length by updating every 0 occurences

### time complexity

$O(n)$, where `n` is the max val of the list

- because youâ€™re going through that many values

### space complexity

$O(n)$, where `n` is the max val of the list

- since the worst case is that you store all the values for 0-n

# ðŸ’¡Â Problem Analysis

### summary

- return the maximum length of the consecutive list you can make in $O(n)$ TC.

### code

```python
# https://neetcode.io/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0: return 0

        m = max(nums)
        n = min(nums)

        h = {}

        for i in range(n, m + 1):
            h[i] = 0
        
        for n in nums:
            h[n] += 1
        
        c = 0
        cmax = 0

        lst = h.values()

        for l in lst:
            c = c + 1 if l != 0 else 0
            cmax = c if c > cmax else cmax

        return cmax
```

### alternative approach

**HashSet**

```python
# https://neetcode.io/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numS = set(nums)
        maxL = 0

        for n in numS:
            if n - 1 not in numS:
                length = 1
                while (n + length) in numS: length += 1
                maxL = max(maxL, length)
        return maxL

# TC: O(n)
# SC: O(n)
```

- you can create a set, then check if the left/right numbers are in the set
- basically, you only start counting if the current number is the left most number, ie there are no `n-1` in the list
- if the current number is the left most number, you check if `n+1` exists in the set and keep the count of the length

### cause of failure

**Empty List Case**

```python
# INPUT:
nums=[]

# OUTPUT:
! error ! when computing max(nums)
```

- `max()` has an error finding the max when the list is empty
- need to handle it separately

### take aways & key points

- set has $O(1)$ TC for searching, and it also doesnâ€™t allow duplicates which we want in this case

create a set â†’ loop through elements in set â†’ check if current element can be the starter â†’ if it can check if n+1 exists in the set â†’ increment the length var and return the max
