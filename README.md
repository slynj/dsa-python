# 💻 Coding Challenge Practice

## 📝 Overview
This section is dedicated to my coding challenge practice, where I solve problems from various platforms to improve my problem-solving and algorithmic skills.

## 🌐 Platforms

Here are the platforms I use to practice coding challenges:

- **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)**: One of the most popular platforms for coding challenges. I focus on solving problems related to data structures, algorithms, and interview preparation.
  
- **[NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/)**: Platform for problem-solving practice, with a focus on essential patterns and strategies.

- **[Baekjoon Online Judge](https://www.acmicpc.net/)**: A platform that provides a wide range of algorithm problems. I practice here to solve more competitive programming problems. 

- **[Programmers](https://programmers.co.kr/)**: A platform offering coding challenges and technical interview problems.

## 📚 Practice Notes

I post detailed notes, explanations, and solutions to the problems I solve on my website. Check out my [Coding Challenge Notes](https://lynjeong.com) for in-depth explanations and code breakdowns. These are also in repo, within the directories along the code. 🗂️

Stay tuned for daily updates and more problem-solving strategies!
